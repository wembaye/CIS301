    <h1> Weldensie personal story </h1>

    <p> My name is Weldensie Teklay Embaye and I was born from gentlemen farmers in the countryside of Eritrea.
        I have completed my BSc in Agricultural Economics at University of Asmara, Eritrea,
        MSc in International Rural Development at University of Ghent, Belgium and
        PhD in Economics at Kansas Stata University, Kansas.

    </p>
    <p> My great interest and intention is to continue my MSc in Software Development at Maharishi University of
        Management.
        I have developed an interest in computer science when I came across number of programing courses during my
        graduate program
        such as java, R, and Stata programing.
